# 3Sum

Find all unique triplets `[a, b, c]` in an integer array such that  
`a + b + c = 0`.

---

## Approach
1. **Sort** the array.
2. Loop through each index `i` as the fixed first number.
3. Use two pointers `L` and `R` on the subarray `(i+1 â€¦ end)` to find pairs
   where `nums[L] + nums[R] = -nums[i]`.
4. **Skip duplicates**:
   * If `nums[i]` is the same as the previous value, continue.
   * After finding a valid triplet, move `L` and `R` past any duplicates.

This guarantees all returned triplets are unique and that every combination is
considered exactly once.

---

## Complexity
* **Time:** `O(n^2)`  
  *Sorting is `O(n log n)`, and the two-pointer scan is `O(n^2)` overall.*
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra (output list excluded).

---

## Notes
* Sorting allows easy duplicate removal and efficient linear scans.
* Using a hash set per iteration would also be `O(n^2)` but slower and more
  complicated to deduplicate.
