# LeetCode C++ Solutions

My personal C++ solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by problem number.  
Each problem folder includes the code and a short explanation of why the approach works.

## Structure
problems/
  0001-two-sum/
    README.md   # reasoning and complexity
    solution.cpp
  0002-add-two-numbers/
    README.md
    solution.cpp

## Notes
Every `README.md` inside a problem folder explains the idea and complexity in my own words.
